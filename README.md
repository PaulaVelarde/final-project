# Final project - VR

Repository with the base code for the final projects making VR in ThreeJS.

### Folder structure

* `www/` - All of the files of the web project. This folder should serve through a server like MAMP.
* `www/css` - App styles.
* `www/js` - Javascript files. This is the most important folder (your code goes here :D).
* `www/js/lib` - Libraries: jQuery and ThreeJS dependencies. You can add all the libs that you need.
* `www/index.html` - The VR app page.
* `www/preview.html` - A preview page, useful in the development.

### VRWorld.js

This file included in the `www/js` folder contains the logic of setup and configuration of ThreeJS World.
Init a 3D scene, a WebGL renderer and two cameras: one for the preview and the camera for the point of view.
